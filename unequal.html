<h1><a name="C7"></a>Chapter 7: <a name="i0"></a>Unequal</h1>
<p>
You have a square grid; each square may contain a digit from 1 to the size of the grid, and some squares have clue signs between them. Your aim is to fully populate the grid with numbers such that:
</p>
<ul><li>
Each row contains only one occurrence of each digit
</li>
<li>
Each column contains only one occurrence of each digit
</li>
<li>
All the clue signs are satisfied.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are two modes for this game, &#8216;Unequal&#8217; and &#8216;Adjacent&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
In &#8216;Unequal&#8217; mode, the clue signs are greater-than symbols indicating one square's value is greater than its neighbour's. In this mode not all clues may be visible, particularly at higher difficulty levels.
</p>
<p>
In &#8216;Adjacent&#8217; mode, the clue signs are bars indicating one square's value is numerically adjacent (i.e. one higher or one lower) than its neighbour. In this mode all clues are always visible: absence of a bar thus means that a square's value is definitely not numerically adjacent to that neighbour's.
</p>
<p>
In &#8216;Trivial&#8217; difficulty level (available via the &#8216;Custom&#8217; game type selector), there are no greater-than signs in &#8216;Unequal&#8217; mode; the puzzle is to solve the <a name="i1"></a>Latin square only.
</p>

<h2><a name="S7.1"></a>7.1 <a name="i1"></a>Common actions</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead (Control and Shift are not available). There is also an optional "Night mode" which uses darker colours in low light.</em>
</p>
<p>
These actions are all available from the <a name="i2"></a>&#8216;Game&#8217; menu and via <a name="i3"></a>keyboard shortcuts, in addition to any game-specific actions.
</p>
<p>
(On <a name="i4"></a>Mac OS X, to conform with local user interface standards, these actions are situated on the <a name="i5"></a>&#8216;File&#8217; and <a name="i6"></a>&#8216;Edit&#8217; menus instead.)
</p>
<dl><dt>
<a name="i7"></a><em>New game</em> (&#8216;N&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;N&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Starts a new game, with a random initial state.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i8"></a><em>Restart game</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Resets the current game to its initial state. (This can be undone.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i9"></a><em>Load</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Loads a saved game from a file on disk.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i10"></a><em>Save</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Saves the current state of your game to a file on disk.
<p>
The Load and Save operations preserve your entire game history (so you can save, reload, and still Undo and Redo things you had done before saving).
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i11"></a><em>Print</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Where supported (currently only on Windows), brings up a dialog allowing you to print an arbitrary number of puzzles randomly generated from the current parameters, optionally including the current puzzle. (Only for puzzles which make sense to print, of course &#8211; it's hard to think of a sensible printable representation of Fifteen!)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i12"></a><em>Undo</em> (&#8216;U&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;Z&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;_&#8217;, &#8216;*&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Undoes a single move. (You can undo moves back to the start of the session.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i13"></a><em>Redo</em> (&#8216;R&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;R&#8217;, &#8216;#&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Redoes a previously undone move.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i14"></a><em>Copy</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Copies the current state of your game to the clipboard in text format, so that you can paste it into (say) an e-mail client or a web message board if you're discussing the game with someone else. (Not all games support this feature.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i15"></a><em>Solve</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Transforms the puzzle instantly into its solved state. For some games (Cube) this feature is not supported at all because it is of no particular use. For other games (such as Pattern), the solved state can be used to give you information, if you can't see how a solution can exist at all or you want to know where you made a mistake. For still other games (such as Sixteen), automatic solution tells you nothing about how to <em>get</em> to the solution, but it does provide a useful way to get there quickly so that you can experiment with set-piece moves and transformations.
<p>
Some games (such as Solo) are capable of solving a game ID you have typed in from elsewhere. Other games (such as Rectangles) cannot solve a game ID they didn't invent themself, but when they did invent the game ID they know what the solution is already. Still other games (Pattern) can solve <em>some</em> external game IDs, but only if they aren't too difficult.
</p>
<p>
The &#8216;Solve&#8217; command adds the solved state to the end of the undo chain for the puzzle. In other words, if you want to go back to solving it yourself after seeing the answer, you can just press Undo.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i16"></a><a name="i17"></a><em>Quit</em> (&#8216;Q&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;Q&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Closes the application entirely.

<h2><a name="S7.2"></a>7.2 <a name="i3"></a>Unequal controls</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead (Control and Shift are not available). There is also an optional "Night mode" which uses darker colours in low light.</em>
</p>
<p>
Unequal shares much of its control system with Solo.
</p>
<p>
To play Unequal, simply click the mouse in any empty square and then type a digit or letter on the keyboard to fill that square. If you make a mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect square and press Space to clear it again (or use the Undo feature).
</p>
<p>
If you <em>right</em>-click in a square and then type a number, that number will be entered in the square as a &#8216;pencil mark&#8217;. You can have pencil marks for multiple numbers in the same square. Squares containing filled-in numbers cannot also contain pencil marks.
</p>
<p>
The game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you use them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about a particular number, or you can use them as lists of the possible numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel like.
</p>
<p>
To erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type the same number again.
</p>
<p>
All pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type a number, or when you left-click and press space. Right-clicking and pressing space will also erase pencil marks.
</p>
<p>
As for Sudoku, the cursor keys can be used in conjunction with the digit keys to set numbers or pencil marks. You can also use the &#8216;M&#8217; key to auto-fill every numeric hint, ready for removal as required, or the &#8216;H&#8217; key to do the same but also to remove all obvious hints.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, use the cursor keys to move the mark around the grid. Pressing the return key toggles the mark (from a normal mark to a pencil mark), and typing a number in is entered in the square in the appropriate way; typing in a 0 or using the space bar will clear a filled square.
</p>
<p>
Left-clicking a clue will mark it as done (grey it out), or unmark it if it is already marked. Holding Control or Shift and pressing an arrow key likewise marks any clue adjacent to the cursor in the given direction.
</p>

<h2><a name="S7.3"></a>7.3 <a name="i4"></a>Unequal parameters</h2>
<p>
These parameters are available from the &#8216;Custom...&#8217; option on the &#8216;Type&#8217; menu.
</p>
<dl><dt>
<em>Mode</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Mode of the puzzle (&#8216;Unequal&#8217; or &#8216;Adjacent&#8217;)
</dd>
<dt>
<em>Size (s*s)</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Size of grid.
</dd>
<dt>
<em>Difficulty</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Controls the difficulty of the generated puzzle. At Trivial level, there are no greater-than signs; the puzzle is to solve the Latin square only. At Recursive level (only available via the &#8216;Custom&#8217; game type selector) backtracking will be required, but the solution should still be unique. The levels in between require increasingly complex reasoning to avoid having to backtrack.
