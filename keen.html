<h1><a name="C2"></a>Chapter 2: <a name="i0"></a>Keen</h1>
<p>
You have a square grid; each square may contain a digit from 1 to the size of the grid. The grid is divided into blocks of varying shape and size, with arithmetic clues written in them. Your aim is to fully populate the grid with digits such that:
</p>
<ul><li>
Each row contains only one occurrence of each digit
</li>
<li>
Each column contains only one occurrence of each digit
</li>
<li>
The digits in each block can be combined to form the number stated in the clue, using the arithmetic operation given in the clue. That is:
<ul><li>
An addition clue means that the sum of the digits in the block must be the given number. For example, &#8216;15+&#8217; means the contents of the block adds up to fifteen.
</li>
<li>
A multiplication clue (e.g. &#8216;60&#215;&#8217;), similarly, means that the product of the digits in the block must be the given number.
</li>
<li>
A subtraction clue will always be written in a block of size two, and it means that one of the digits in the block is greater than the other by the given amount. For example, &#8216;2&#8722;&#8217; means that one of the digits in the block is 2 more than the other, or equivalently that one digit minus the other one is 2. The two digits could be either way round, though.
</li>
<li>
A division clue (e.g. &#8216;3&#247;&#8217;), similarly, is always in a block of size two and means that one digit divided by the other is equal to the given amount.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that a block may contain the same digit more than once (provided the identical ones are not in the same row and column). This rule is precisely the opposite of the rule in Sudoku's &#8216;Killer&#8217; mode (see <a href="sudoku.html#C5">chapter 5</a>).

<h2><a name="S2.1"></a>2.1 <a name="i1"></a>Common actions</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead (Control and Shift are not available). There is also an optional "Night mode" which uses darker colours in low light.</em>
</p>
<p>
These actions are all available from the <a name="i2"></a>&#8216;Game&#8217; menu and via <a name="i3"></a>keyboard shortcuts, in addition to any game-specific actions.
</p>
<p>
(On <a name="i4"></a>Mac OS X, to conform with local user interface standards, these actions are situated on the <a name="i5"></a>&#8216;File&#8217; and <a name="i6"></a>&#8216;Edit&#8217; menus instead.)
</p>
<dl><dt>
<a name="i7"></a><em>New game</em> (&#8216;N&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;N&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Starts a new game, with a random initial state.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i8"></a><em>Restart game</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Resets the current game to its initial state. (This can be undone.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i9"></a><em>Load</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Loads a saved game from a file on disk.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i10"></a><em>Save</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Saves the current state of your game to a file on disk.
<p>
The Load and Save operations preserve your entire game history (so you can save, reload, and still Undo and Redo things you had done before saving).
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i11"></a><em>Print</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Where supported (currently only on Windows), brings up a dialog allowing you to print an arbitrary number of puzzles randomly generated from the current parameters, optionally including the current puzzle. (Only for puzzles which make sense to print, of course &#8211; it's hard to think of a sensible printable representation of Fifteen!)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i12"></a><em>Undo</em> (&#8216;U&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;Z&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;_&#8217;, &#8216;*&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Undoes a single move. (You can undo moves back to the start of the session.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i13"></a><em>Redo</em> (&#8216;R&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;R&#8217;, &#8216;#&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Redoes a previously undone move.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i14"></a><em>Copy</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Copies the current state of your game to the clipboard in text format, so that you can paste it into (say) an e-mail client or a web message board if you're discussing the game with someone else. (Not all games support this feature.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i15"></a><em>Solve</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Transforms the puzzle instantly into its solved state. For some games (Cube) this feature is not supported at all because it is of no particular use. For other games (such as Pattern), the solved state can be used to give you information, if you can't see how a solution can exist at all or you want to know where you made a mistake. For still other games (such as Sixteen), automatic solution tells you nothing about how to <em>get</em> to the solution, but it does provide a useful way to get there quickly so that you can experiment with set-piece moves and transformations.
<p>
Some games (such as Solo) are capable of solving a game ID you have typed in from elsewhere. Other games (such as Rectangles) cannot solve a game ID they didn't invent themself, but when they did invent the game ID they know what the solution is already. Still other games (Pattern) can solve <em>some</em> external game IDs, but only if they aren't too difficult.
</p>
<p>
The &#8216;Solve&#8217; command adds the solved state to the end of the undo chain for the puzzle. In other words, if you want to go back to solving it yourself after seeing the answer, you can just press Undo.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i16"></a><a name="i17"></a><em>Quit</em> (&#8216;Q&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;Q&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Closes the application entirely.
</dd>

<h2><a name="S2.2"></a>2.2 <a name="i2"></a>Keen controls</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead (Control and Shift are not available). There is also an optional "Night mode" which uses darker colours in low light.</em>
</p>
<p>
Keen shares much of its control system with Solo (and Unequal).
</p>
<p>
To play Keen, simply click the mouse in any empty square and then type a digit on the keyboard to fill that square. If you make a mistake, click the mouse in the incorrect square and press Space to clear it again (or use the Undo feature).
</p>
<p>
If you <em>right</em>-click in a square and then type a number, that number will be entered in the square as a &#8216;pencil mark&#8217;. You can have pencil marks for multiple numbers in the same square. Squares containing filled-in numbers cannot also contain pencil marks.
</p>
<p>
The game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you use them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about a particular number, or you can use them as lists of the possible numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel like.
</p>
<p>
To erase a single pencil mark, right-click in the square and type the same number again.
</p>
<p>
All pencil marks in a square are erased when you left-click and type a number, or when you left-click and press space. Right-clicking and pressing space will also erase pencil marks.
</p>
<p>
As for Solo, the cursor keys can be used in conjunction with the digit keys to set numbers or pencil marks. Use the cursor keys to move a highlight around the grid, and type a digit to enter it in the highlighted square. Pressing return toggles the highlight into a mode in which you can enter or remove pencil marks.
</p>
<p>
Pressing M will fill in a full set of pencil marks in every square that does not have a main digit in it.
</p>

<h2><a name="S2.3"></a>2.3 <a name="i3"></a>Keen parameters</h2>
<p>
These parameters are available from the &#8216;Custom...&#8217; option on the &#8216;Type&#8217; menu.
</p>
<dl><dt>
<em>Grid size</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Specifies the size of the grid. Lower limit is 3; upper limit is 9 (because the user interface would become more difficult with &#8216;digits&#8217; bigger than 9!).
</dd>
<dt>
<em>Difficulty</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Controls the difficulty of the generated puzzle. At Unreasonable level, some backtracking will be required, but the solution should still be unique. The remaining levels require increasingly complex reasoning to avoid having to backtrack.
</dd>
<dt>
<em>Multiplication only</em>
</dt>
<dd>
If this is enabled, all boxes will be multiplication boxes. With this rule, the puzzle is known as &#8216;Inshi No Heya&#8217;.
</dd>
