<h1><a name="C3"></a>Chapter 3: <a name="i0"></a>Palisade</h1>
<p>
You're given a grid of squares, some of which contain numbers. Your goal is to subdivide the grid into contiguous regions, all of the same (given) size, such that each square containing a number is adjacent to exactly that many edges (including those between the inside and the outside of the grid).
</p>

<h2><a name="S3.1"></a>3.1 <a name="i1"></a>Common actions</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead (Control and Shift are not available). There is also an optional "Night mode" which uses darker colours in low light.</em>
</p>
<p>
These actions are all available from the <a name="i2"></a>&#8216;Game&#8217; menu and via <a name="i3"></a>keyboard shortcuts, in addition to any game-specific actions.
</p>
<p>
(On <a name="i4"></a>Mac OS X, to conform with local user interface standards, these actions are situated on the <a name="i5"></a>&#8216;File&#8217; and <a name="i6"></a>&#8216;Edit&#8217; menus instead.)
</p>
<dl><dt>
<a name="i7"></a><em>New game</em> (&#8216;N&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;N&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Starts a new game, with a random initial state.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i8"></a><em>Restart game</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Resets the current game to its initial state. (This can be undone.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i9"></a><em>Load</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Loads a saved game from a file on disk.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i10"></a><em>Save</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Saves the current state of your game to a file on disk.
<p>
The Load and Save operations preserve your entire game history (so you can save, reload, and still Undo and Redo things you had done before saving).
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i11"></a><em>Print</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Where supported (currently only on Windows), brings up a dialog allowing you to print an arbitrary number of puzzles randomly generated from the current parameters, optionally including the current puzzle. (Only for puzzles which make sense to print, of course &#8211; it's hard to think of a sensible printable representation of Fifteen!)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i12"></a><em>Undo</em> (&#8216;U&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;Z&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;_&#8217;, &#8216;*&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Undoes a single move. (You can undo moves back to the start of the session.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i13"></a><em>Redo</em> (&#8216;R&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;R&#8217;, &#8216;#&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Redoes a previously undone move.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i14"></a><em>Copy</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Copies the current state of your game to the clipboard in text format, so that you can paste it into (say) an e-mail client or a web message board if you're discussing the game with someone else. (Not all games support this feature.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i15"></a><em>Solve</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Transforms the puzzle instantly into its solved state. For some games (Cube) this feature is not supported at all because it is of no particular use. For other games (such as Pattern), the solved state can be used to give you information, if you can't see how a solution can exist at all or you want to know where you made a mistake. For still other games (such as Sixteen), automatic solution tells you nothing about how to <em>get</em> to the solution, but it does provide a useful way to get there quickly so that you can experiment with set-piece moves and transformations.
<p>
Some games (such as Solo) are capable of solving a game ID you have typed in from elsewhere. Other games (such as Rectangles) cannot solve a game ID they didn't invent themself, but when they did invent the game ID they know what the solution is already. Still other games (Pattern) can solve <em>some</em> external game IDs, but only if they aren't too difficult.
</p>
<p>
The &#8216;Solve&#8217; command adds the solved state to the end of the undo chain for the puzzle. In other words, if you want to go back to solving it yourself after seeing the answer, you can just press Undo.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i16"></a><a name="i17"></a><em>Quit</em> (&#8216;Q&#8217;, Ctrl+&#8216;Q&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Closes the application entirely.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="S3.2"></a>3.2 <a name="i2"></a>Palisade controls</h2>

Left-click to place an edge. Right-click to indicate &#8216;no edge&#8217;. Alternatively, the arrow keys will move a keyboard cursor. Holding Control while pressing an arrow key will place an edge. Press Shift-arrowkey to switch off an edge. Repeat an action to perform its inverse.
</p>
